# Day 04 Practical Sessions - Calculator App Development (Part 3) ðŸ”¢

Welcome to **Day 04** of the Calculator App Project! In this session, we've made significant progress in developing the app, implementing key features and enhancing functionality. This project showcases the step-by-step development of a fully functional calculator app using Axure RP 9.

ðŸš€ **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to develop a fully functional calculator app with an intuitive, user-friendly interface and interactive features. We are using **Axure RP 9** to design the interface and define interactions. This repository will be updated regularly to reflect the latest progress in the development process.

## What's New in Day 04:

In **Day 04**, we've fully implemented all basic arithmetic operations and other key functions for the calculator. The app now includes the following features:

- **Complete Functionality for Basic Operations**: +, -, *, /
- **Implemented Special Functions**: AC (All Clear), +/- (Negate), %, and .
- **Equals (=) Button**: Fully operational to calculate and display results.
  
This session marks the completion of all major functional operations required for a basic calculator.

## Features Implemented in Day 04:

### 1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations (+, -, *, /)**
   - All four fundamental arithmetic operations are now fully functional.
   - When an operation is pressed (like +, -, *, or /), the corresponding operation is applied to the values on the screen.
   - The app supports sequential operations and correct precedence handling.
   - Example:
     - Input: `5 + 3 * 2` will return `11`.

### 2. **AC (All Clear) Button**
   - Clears the screen and resets the calculator to the initial state.
   - **Output**: After clicking "AC", the screen resets to `0` and all stored values are cleared.

### 3. **+/- (Negate) Button**
   - Switches the sign of the current number displayed on the screen from positive to negative, or vice versa.
   - **Output**: If the screen shows `5`, clicking `+/-` will change it to `-5`.

### 4. **% (Percentage) Button**
   - Converts the current value on the screen to a percentage.
   - **Output**: If the screen shows `50`, clicking `%` will change the value to `0.5`.

### 5. **Decimal Point (.) Button**
   - Adds a decimal point to the number on the screen.
   - **Output**: If the screen shows `5`, clicking `.` will change it to `5.` and allows further input of decimals.

### 6. **Equals (=) Button**
   - Performs the calculation based on the numbers and operations entered.
   - Displays the result of the calculation.
   - **Example**: If the screen shows `5 + 3 * 2`, clicking `=` will display `11`.

## Features Implemented in Previous Days:

### Day 02:

- **Basic Calculator Interface**: A simple layout with a screen and number pad (0-9).
- **Number Pad Interactions**: Numbers (1-9) and 0 are clickable and update the screen.
- **Flag and Saved Number**: Introduced flags to determine if input should replace the existing value or append to it.

### Day 03:

- **Enhanced Interface and Functionality**: Improved previous weekâ€™s design.
- **Implemented Key Functions**: AC (Clear), +/- (Negate), and % (Percentage) buttons.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (partially implemented).
